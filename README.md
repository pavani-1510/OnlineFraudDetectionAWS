# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial security, affecting millions of transactions globally. This project aims to develop an effective fraud detection system by leveraging machine learning techniques. The objective is to improve detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and provide a robust fraud prevention mechanism.

## Problem Statement
Traditional fraud detection methods often struggle with accuracy due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones. This project addresses these challenges using advanced machine learning models and feature selection techniques to enhance fraud detection performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Amazon SageMaker** for model training and deployment
- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** for machine learning model implementation
- **AWS** for cloud computing and scalability

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of anonymized credit card transactions with a significant class imbalance. Advanced resampling and feature engineering techniques are applied to ensure accurate fraud identification.
